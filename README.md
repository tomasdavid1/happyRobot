# Test Scheduler App

## Overview

Hi! Following the requirements I made this carbon copy of a Test Scheduler App. It's an application designed to manage and visualize scheduled tests efficiently. It features a calendar interface where users can add, edit, and view test schedules with repeatable weekly patterns. The app utilizes modern tools such as Next.js, Supabase, and TailwindCSS to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Calendar**:
  - Displays weekly schedules.
  - Allows navigation between weeks with intuitive controls.
  - Highlights scheduled events with visual clarity.
  - Filters by time, start date and potentially end date. Implemented, not required

- **Event Management**:
  - Add new events using a modal form.
  - Edit existing events by clicking on them in the calendar.
  - Set start date, time, and repeat days for events.
  
- **State Management**:
  - Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback.
  - Context providers for shared state across components.
    


- **Database Integration**:
  - Real-time updates using Supabase's `postgres_changes`.
  - Persistent storage for events.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **State Management**: React Context and Hooks
- **Date Utilities**: `date-fns`

## Development Notes

- **Optimistic Updates**: Events are added to the UI immediately after scheduling, ensuring a responsive experience.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Supabase listens for changes to the `events` table and updates the calendar dynamically.
- **Custom Styling**: TailwindCSS is used for modern, responsive designs.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for recurring events with end dates.
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for events.
- Enhance event filtering and search.
- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).
